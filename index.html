               <h2> BIO </h2>
          <p>I am from Rome, I spent a considerable amount of my life learning modern languages and listening to rock music. I have made a living from the first and a lifestyle of the latter.<p/>

 <p>I am fluent in Italian, English, Spanish and German. Some might say I speak too much, but I think they’re just envious.<p/>
          
 <p>I moved to London about 4 years ago, and in London I have learned that only one thing is better than learning a new language: that one thing is teaching it to who wants to learn.</p>

<p>I have been teaching languages for over 2 years in a Secondary school in Hackney. Apart from grammar, I hope my students learnt that languages are important even if they’re never thinking of leaving their neighbour.</p>
            
<p>However, I felt like I needed to learn something new, a new language or two, but not for speaking to people; I left my school to invest all my time in learning how to communicate with machines. </p>
            
            <p> I consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to preparing and delivering lessons to students as well as in coding. I always try to go for the simplest solution, even though in coding this is not what always happens.</p>
            
            <p> After a short part-time Python course last year and tons of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT independent learning, I would now like to join Founders & Coders to kick-start my new career.</p>
            
            <p>My hobbies are reading, cycling, listening to music and playing drums.</p>

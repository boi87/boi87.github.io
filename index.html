               <h2> BIO </h2>
          <p>I've been living in London for 3 years and working as a Secondary Modern Languages teachers for two.
               After all the teaching I needed some good old learning though, so I decided to leave my full time
               occupation in school and invest all my time in learning how to code.
          <br/>

          I consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to preparing and delivering lessons to kids as well as in coding.
                I always try to go for the simplest solution, even though in coding this is not what always happens!
          <br/>
          After a short part-time Python course last year and few short courses in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT this winter I found out what I really wanted to get best at.
          </p>
          <p>My hobbies are cycling, listening to music and playing drums.

               <h2> BIO </h2>
                           
         <p>I am from Rome, I spent a considerable amount of my life learning modern languages and listening to rock music. I have made a living from the first and a lifestyle of the latter.<p/>

 <p>I am fluent in Italian, English, Spanish and German. Some might say I speak too much, but I think theyâ€™re just envious.<p/>
          
 <p>I moved to London about 4 years ago, and here I have learned that only one thing is as rewarding as Learning, and that one thing is Teaching.</p>

<p>I have been teaching languages for over 2 years in a secondary school in Hackney, a challenging yet very rewarding job. However, I have always been fond of IT, so I realized that the best I could do with my skills was to learn another language or two, but this time not human ones.</p>
  
  <p> So I left my school and my kids to invest all my time in learning how to communicate with machines.   </p>
            
            <p> After a short part-time Python course last year and tons of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT independent learning, I would now like to join Founders & Coders to kick-start my new career.</p>
            
            <p> I consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to preparing and delivering lessons to students as well as in coding. I always try to go for the simplest solution, even though in coding this is not what always happens.</p>
            
            <p>My hobbies are reading, cycling, listening to music and playing drums.</p>
